Altogether, more than 10000 students that pass out from them every year either choose to opt for further studies, work or have their own startups. Currently, there is no mechanism for the colleges and the Directorate to keep a track of the students passing out. Hence, the problem is to develop a web based application for colleges and the Directorate to keep a track of the Alumni. The said application should have the following features:- (a) allow the Alumni members to register themselves (b) allow colleges to verify and authenticate their registered alumni (c) provision for alumni members to update their details (d) allow the colleges to search details based on criteria such as year, subject, etc. (e) allow the Directorate to search details based on criteria such as colleges, year, subject, etc. (f) send messages and emails to alumni members (g) group chats, create events, publish notices on the portal (h) Security features with login for every user.

However, it stands 97th in Oxfam’s Food Availability Index, and 103rd in the 2018 Global Hunger Index. The major cause could be the wastage of food produced at various levels. With the constant rise in population, India will have to smartly manage its food resources. We have to develop smart management techniques for food storage and reduce the wastage. Develop an application to provide a network of ware houses and farmers. Engage a logistic provider network to enable farmers directly use the network to sell their produce. Additionally provide facility to access warehouses and cold storages. Such a network will also enable judging whether enough storage capacity is available and also provide optimal usage of the facilities available.

For a given entrance gate a hardware-software solution is needed to identify every unique person who enters or exit the gate, with log of all previous entry/exit time, photo/videos recorded. That means there will not be a previous history of an individual on the first entry. The system should immediately alert the security if it is a new person and the security will decide to allow/restrict that person entering inside the premises. Whereas, the system should learn from its previous history of videos/images dynamically to allow a known person. For a given size of the gate, the number of cameras with optimal resolution required is also to be worked out as part of solution. The solution should be scalable and preferably based open source.

                <td>Tourism in India is important for the country economy and is growing rapidly. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to rupees 32.05 lakh crore(US$460 billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP). In October 2015, India medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020. In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical treatment.Students teams are expected to develop a context-based NLP engine to guide the tourists using MindMeld capabilities. MindMeld is a platform to power the next generation of chat and voice assistants. It is an AI platform for building conversational interfaces. Solution Expected: The requirements are to develop a WebEx Team bot capable of NLP to guide tourists. Student teams can choose any one from some of the scenarios that we have listed below. Tourism can be classified into the following sectors and provide help based on the nature of tourism. 1. Cruise Tourism - An itinerary Manager that proposes day-by-day schedule of the cruise with a complete list of attractions at each place along with the route navigation system. 2. Adventure Tourism - Since its adventures the bot must provide a tailor-made experience offering a personalized answer and suitable options based on the situations along with appropriate reminders based on the tourist spot visited. The old-fashioned concept of showcasing only India historical heritage and monuments is changing and people around the world are more interested in ecotourism where they want to see the local flora and fauna. Increasing tourism in the Sundarbans area in West Bengal is an attractive proposition. The region contains the biggest mangrove forest in the world and exotic flora and fauna and the Royal Bengal Tiger. Tech recommendation:   The Conversational AI Playbook can be integrated with Webex Teams and help tourists in the following key areas like Travel Planner – The Chatbot must act as a virtual travel agent who is able to share the suggestions based on the users travel preferences. It should be capable to check the Hotel Room Availability Recommend the right package based on tourist profile. Keep tourist informed about the details of the journey like check ins, flight /Train status etc. Route complex queries to human agents in real time (Adventure Tourism) The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria:  1. Depth and research to understand Indian Tourism Industry (Domain Knowledge) 2. Depth of understanding of Mind meld capabilities & Business model use cases.  4. Depth and understanding of technologies proposed in solution, e.g. Mindmeld & WebEx Teams bot Resources:  https://www.mindmeld.com/docs/integrations/webex_teams.html https://www.mindmeld.com/docs/blueprints/overview.html

The programme supplies free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in Government schools. Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centers, it is the largest of its kind in the world. Student teams are expected to build machine vision solution to monitor the activities under the Mid-day Meal Scheme. Solution Expected: As the Mid-Day Meal program runs in schools across the country, continuous auditing and monitoring of the program might be challenging. Typical Auditing and Monitoring could involve: Ensuring number of students that took meal is same number reported. Lunch served is same as published/reported menu. Alerting in case of discrepancy and capability to centrally see past records / proof (numbers and visual) for any school. To design modules based on the above mentioned activities, video feed shall be provided to the student teams. These feeds shall come from the Meraki security camera. Typically, these shall come from the actual / imitated site i.e. schools, food serving area etc. Student teams are expected to explore the capabilities of Meraki camera’s inbuilt Machine learning (ML) modules and develop solutions around it. E.g. counting students, object recognition etc. Meraki security camera also has an inbuilt functionality to capture snapshot photos. Teams are expected to generate their own database based on the region of interest and features they wish to extract to develop ML models. Along with the expectations of Auditing & Monitoring the student teams should also propose innovative ideas (backed with research) to extract additional information from above snapshots / photos. While architecting the entire system, teams may explore the scalability factor of the system. The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria: 1. Depth and research to understand Mid-Day meal scheme monitoring problem. 2. Depth of understanding of Meraki camera product capabilities use cases. 3. Depth and understanding of technologies proposed in solution.
